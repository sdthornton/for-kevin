          <strong>Bidding info:</strong> All bids must be greater than $15 and
          be a multiple of $5. At the event, you'll be able to pay for your bid
          with cash, card, or check. Fraternity members can'buy out' a bid by
          paying $75 more than the highest bid. If they buy out the bid you
          won't get to cut the hair, but we will raise more for charity,
          so it's a good thing.
