      Let's cut to the chase. It's U of A Theta Chi's annual philanthropy
      event. We provide the hair and you provide the cut... and the money too.
      But it all goes to a good cause. We're supporting brain tumor research,
      and when you bid you'll be supporting it too. You'll be our
      &ldquo;mane&rdquo; associates in the fight against cancer. That's right,
      give a guy a funny haircut and give cancer the ol' one, two. You don't
      have to be Sherlock Combs to deduce that this is a great thing,
      so play your part.
