Congratulations!
=========================
You have the winning bid!
=========================

That's right, your <%= number_to_currency(@bid.amount) %> on <%= @haircut.member %> was the winning bid. That means you've earned the right to give <%= first_name(@haircut.member) %> any haircut you want. What's more, your bid helped us raise <%= bid_total %> for Students Supporting Brain Tumor Research. That's amazing. Give yourself a pat on the back.

Now that you're a big winner, it's all the more important that you come to the Theta Chi house from 4 to 7pm tonight. There will be a live DJ tonight and professional stylists from Toni&Guy there (just in case you'd like a little help).

502 N Campbell Ave.
Tucson, AZ 85719

And don't forget to bring cash, check, or a credit card tonight for all your winning bids.

See you soon!
