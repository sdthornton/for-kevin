It's Almost Time for the Main Event

===========================================
Which means that bidding is about to close!
===========================================

You have just about a day left before bidding closes for the year. Are there any handsome men you'd like to give a terrible haircut to but for whom you haven't taken the time yet to place a bid? Well hurry up! There's only about a day left! And remember, every dolar we raise through your bids goes directly to support Students Supporting Brain Tumor Research.

And don't forget, tomorrow, April 30th at 10am we'll be meeting at Mama's Hawaiian Bar-B-Cue for percentage day. On Thursday, May 1st, from 6 to 8pm there will be a dance competition in Modern Languages room 350. And on Friday, May 2, from 4 to 7pm we look forward to seeing you at the Theta Chi house for the haircutting extravaganza!
